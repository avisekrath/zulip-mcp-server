## [1.5.0] - 2025-06-21

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- **Terminology Standardization**: All tools now use "stream" terminology instead of "channel"
  - `get-subscribed-channels` ‚Üí `get-subscribed-streams`
  - `get-channel-id` ‚Üí `get-stream-id`
  - `get-channel-by-id` ‚Üí `get-stream-by-id`
  - `get-topics-in-channel` ‚Üí `get-topics-in-stream`
  - `channels-directory` resource ‚Üí `streams-directory`

### üöÄ Added
- **New Helper Tools** (3 new tools, total now 25):
  - `search-users` - Find users by name/email before sending DMs
  - `get-started` - Test connection and get workspace overview
  - `get-user` - Get detailed user information by ID
- **Enhanced Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive "Streams vs Channels" terminology sections
  - Clear migration guidance for users familiar with "channels"
  - Workflow documentation and tool selection guides
- **LLM Usability Features**:
  - Helper tools for discovery and orientation
  - Enhanced error messages with contextual guidance
  - Quick tips and troubleshooting information

### üîß Improved
- **Documentation Quality**:
  - Updated all tool descriptions for consistency
  - Added terminology explanations throughout

  - Enhanced CLAUDE.md with comprehensive implementation guidance
- **Code Quality**:
  - Fixed schema naming inconsistencies
  - Improved TypeScript type safety
  - Better error handling and validation
  - Consistent variable naming throughout codebase
- **Developer Experience**:
  - Enhanced development scripts and quality checks

### üìñ Migration Guide
If you're upgrading from v1.0.0:

1. **Update Tool Names**: Replace any references to old channel-based tool names:
   ```diff
   - get-subscribed-channels
   + get-subscribed-streams
   
   - get-channel-id
   + get-stream-id
   
   - get-channel-by-id
   + get-stream-by-id
   
   - get-topics-in-channel
   + get-topics-in-stream
   ```

2. **Update Resource URIs**: 
   ```diff
   - zulip://channels
   + zulip://streams
   ```

3. **Note**: All functionality remains the same - only names have changed for consistency. In Zulip, "streams" and "channels" refer to the same concept.
